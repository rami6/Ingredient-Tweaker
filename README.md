# Ingredient-Tweaker
This app is for cases of...
- Recipe says "3 eggs", but you have only "2 eggs"
- Recipe says "150g of pork", but you want to use "800g of pork" for a party

Once you input original amounts and set an adjusted amount to be a base, you can see adjusted amounts of all ingredients.

You can hide original amounts for convenience.
